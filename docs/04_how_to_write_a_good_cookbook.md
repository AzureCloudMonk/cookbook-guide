## How to Write a "Good" Cookbook
* "Good" is subjective, but there are guidelines to do better.
* Use the ChefDK for development.
 * [downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
 * `chef generate cookbook`
 * Fill in the appropriate content.
 * Check the `LICENSE.md`. (We prefer Apache v2.)

## Naming your cookbook
* You should name your cookbook for what it is.
* Be as descriptive as possible.
* You should take note of [RFC-078](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc078-supermarket-prefix.md) in case for prefixing your cookbook for the supermarket.
