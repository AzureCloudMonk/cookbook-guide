## How to Write a "Good" Cookbook
* "Good" is subjective, but there are guidelines to do better
* Use the ChefDK
 * <https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/>
 * `chef generate cookbook`
 * This is a good starter skeleton, fill in the content where appropriate
 * Check the `LICENSE.md` (we prefer Apache v2)
