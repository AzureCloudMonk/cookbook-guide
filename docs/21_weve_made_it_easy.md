## We've made it easy to start

* We have created a cookbook generator to work with the ChefDK.
* [Cookbook-guide generator](https://github.com/chef-partners/cookbook-guide-generator)
* Install the ChefDK, clone down the above repo, and then:
```shell
$ chef generate cookbook -g ~/cookbook-guide-generator/cookbooks your-new-cookbook-name
```
* You get a skeleton of everything we mention in this presentation.
* Fill out the TODOs and your specific code and you're pretty much done!
