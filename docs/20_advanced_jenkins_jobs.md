## Advanced Jenkins Jobs
* [jenkins-job-builder][jjb] is a `yaml` based way to configure a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/index.html) server.
* Having jenkins and jenkins-jobs like [this example][minecraftyml] can help automate validation of the cookbooks and changes from the community.
* You can gate integration tests on public clouds with test-kitchen and Jenkins.
* These can be used to compliment hosted [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) tests.
