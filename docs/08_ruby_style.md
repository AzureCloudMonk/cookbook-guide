## How do we Test? Ruby Style
* [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
 * included with the [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
* Ruby static code analyzer and style enforcement
 * Community Ruby style guide, which is still very subjective
* Document your overrides or disagreements and move on
 * Considering implications of rules is more important than blindly following
* No established default, but there is a lot of cargo-culting
 * The MySQL one is a good starter
