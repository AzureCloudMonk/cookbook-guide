# How do we Test our Cookbook? Ruby Style #
* Rubocop
* Ruby static code analyzer and style enforcement
 * Community Ruby style guide, which is still very subjective
* Document overrides or disagreements and move on
 * Considering implications of rules is more important than blindly following
* We haven't established a default, but there is a lot of cargo-culting
 * The MySQL one is a good starter
